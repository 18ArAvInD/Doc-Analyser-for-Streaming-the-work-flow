User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization to secure access to the application. This could involve user registration, login/logout functionality, and role-based access control.

Analytics and Insights: Analyze parsed content to extract insights or generate analytics reports. For example, you could perform sentiment analysis, entity recognition, or keyword extraction to identify trends or patterns within documents


1. **Document Classification:**
   - **Use Case:** A law firm receives various legal documents, including contracts, agreements, and court filings, from clients. They need to organize these documents efficiently for case management and retrieval.
   - **Implementation:**
     - **Data Collection:** Gather a labeled dataset of legal documents representing different categories (e.g., contracts, agreements, court filings).
     - **Feature Extraction:** Preprocess the documents to extract relevant features, such as keywords, document length, and language.
     - **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model, such as a support vector machine (SVM) or a deep neural network, using the labeled dataset to classify documents into predefined categories.
     - **Integration:** Integrate the trained model into the application's backend to automatically classify incoming documents based on their content. Tag each document with the appropriate category for easy organization and retrieval.

2. **Real-time Document Analysis and Insights:**
   - **Use Case:** A marketing agency receives customer feedback surveys in various formats (e.g., text, PDF, images) and needs to extract insights to improve marketing strategies.
   - **Implementation:**
     - **Data Collection:** Collect a diverse dataset of customer feedback surveys, including text-based responses, scanned documents, and images.
     - **Text Extraction:** Use optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to extract text from scanned documents and images.
     - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Apply NLP techniques, such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, to analyze the extracted text and extract meaningful insights.
     - **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilize sentiment analysis algorithms to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of customer feedback.
     - **Visualization:** Present the analyzed data using interactive dashboards and visualizations, such as word clouds, sentiment charts, and topic models, to provide actionable insights to the marketing team in real time.

3. **Document Comparison:**
   - **Use Case:** A software development team collaborates on drafting technical specifications documents, and multiple team members make revisions. They need a tool to compare different versions of the document and track changes effectively.
   - **Implementation:**
     - **Text Differencing:** Implement a text differencing algorithm, such as the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm or the Myers' diff algorithm, to compare the content of two documents and identify differences.
     - **Formatting Comparison:** Compare formatting elements, such as font styles, colors, and indentation, between document versions to highlight formatting changes.
     - **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface that displays the compared documents side by side, with highlighted changes and annotations. Provide options for users to accept or reject individual changes and merge revisions seamlessly.
     - **Version Control Integration:** Integrate the document comparison feature with version control systems, such as Git or SVN, to track changes over time and maintain a history of document revisions.

By implementing these features, your document management application can offer advanced functionalities that address specific use cases and provide valuable solutions to users in various industries.
